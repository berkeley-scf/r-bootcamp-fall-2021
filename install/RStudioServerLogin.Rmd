If you're not able to install R and RStudio on your laptop, you can access RStudio through a web browser.

You'll be using RStudio through a front-end interface called Jupyter that will manage starting RStudio.

1) Go to https://datahub.berkeley.edu/user-redirect/rstudio

2) Select "Log in to continue" and use your CalNet credentials to login.

3) You'll be prompted by DataHub to "Authorize" access to your account. Click "Authorize".

4) At this point, to make the bootcamp materials accessible to your RStudio session, you'll need to do the following:

Within RStudio go to File->New Project->Version Control->Git and enter:

- "Repository URL": https://github.com/berkeley-scf/r-bootcamp-fall-2021
- "Project Directory Name": r-bootcamp-fall-2021 (or something else of your choosing)
- "Create project as a subdirectory of": Browse to the directory where you'd like the bootcamp materials to be located.

Then to update from the repository to get any changes we've made, you can select (from within RStudio):
Tools->Version Control->Pull Branches

or from the Environment/History/Git window, click on the Git tab and then on the blue down arrow.

5) To restart RStudio (e.g., if you're having a problem with R), click on the orange power button in the upper right.

6) To end your session entirely, just kill the browser or browser tab. If you've saved code files or data files, they should be available when you log back in.
